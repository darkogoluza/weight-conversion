Made with vanillaÂ Javascript with addition of gsap for animations

This is a small app I made for practice sake, It converts weight from one unit to another. On the left is an input field where you input your value and on the right you will get your results, also each field has its own dropdown menu where you can select your desired unit.There are 5 default units: kg, gram, oz, pound and ton. You can also add your own units, they are stored on local storage.
